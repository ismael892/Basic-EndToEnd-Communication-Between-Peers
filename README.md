# Basic End To End Communication Between Peers
Basic system for an end to end communication between peers.


### Goal of this project
The goal is practice real project management with this "mock project", gathering requirements, designing use cases and the structure of the system, using various diagrams and tools to represent the system functioning, and only after that start to code, as well as making test cases to make sure the risks and defects are at minimum. The project will only finish after it has passed the testing phase with at least 90% of tests coverage.  

Hopefully it will also serve as a guide to start improving project management, and maybe also to solve doubts about communication between computers but the code in this case will be secondary.


### How will this project be carried
As a practice project it will be managed thoroughly, and the documentation must be precise as in most projects there will be another person that comes after you and takes over from where you left it.
